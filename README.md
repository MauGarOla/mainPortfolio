# mainPortfolio
This is a portfolio of some of the projects I have done in my training as a data analyst.

About me
I needed to graduate in Finance and Public Accounting to realize that I want to dedicate myself to programming.
I am interested in the possibility of turning seemingly chaotic data into meaningful information to improve processes, make smarter decisions, and discover innovative insights that drive progress.
You know you're where you're supposed to be when you think about working for 1 hour, and 5 hours go by without you realizing it.

My portfolio will and need to show my skills, in this caase:
· Extracting data from websites (web scraping): Showcase my code with comments to explain my thought process.
· Data Cleaning: Take a dataset with missing information, duplicates, or other problematic data, and walk through the data cleaning process.
· Performing different types of analysis: Utilize the data to perform diagnostic, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis.
· Data Visualization to tell a story: Create a chart, map, graph, or other visualization to make your data more easily understandable.
· Communicating complex ideas: Consider writing a blog post describing my process or explaining a challenging data concept to highlight my communication skills.
· Collaboration with others: If I have worked on a group project, make sure to include it.
· Using data analysis tools: Share projects that demonstrate my ability to use SQL, Python, R, Tableau, etc.
